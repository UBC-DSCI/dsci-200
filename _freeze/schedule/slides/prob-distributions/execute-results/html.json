Outcomes or events may not be equally likely.\n\n## Terminology\n\n<br>\n\n- **Outcomes**: possible results of the random phenomenon, not necessarily numeric (e.g, side of a coin, students selected for a survey)\n\n- **Events**: a collection of outcomes (e.g, winning all games of the season) \n\n- **Probability of events**: a number between 0 and 1 that measures the uncertainty of an event, how likely an event is to occur.\n\n::: {.callout-note}\nIn many situations, we won't be focus on defining the set of all possible outcomes (aka sample space).

The name reflects two ideas: the value can change (it’s a variable), and it's uncertain which value it will take (it’s *random*).\n:::\n\n\n## Random variable notation\n\n- Random variables are usually represented by **uppercase letters** (e.g., \\( X \\), \\( Y \\), \\( Z \\))\n- The values they take are represented by **lowercase letters** (e.g., \\( x \\), \\( y \\), \\( z \\))\n\nExample: tossing a coin \n\n- Let $X$ represent the number of \"heads\"\n- Possible values:\n  - $x = 1$ → outcome is \"heads\"\n  - $x = 0$ → outcome is \"tails\"\n\n## Distribution\n\n<br>\n\nThe **distribution of a random variable**: is a function that describes the variability of the random variable.\n\n:::incremental\n- We write this as: $$X \\sim \\text{Distribution}(\\text{parameters})$$\n- Just like we can have parameters from a finite population, a distribution takes parameters that describe the behavior of a random variable across all possible values\n\n- Distributions can be used to calculate probabilities associated with random variables. \n\n- In some cases, but not always, the distribution is defined by a specific formula. \n\n- Some distributions have have special names (e.g., Bernoulli, Normal)\n:::\n\n## Finite vs Model-Based \n\nIn Statistics and Data Science:\n\n- rows of data can be thought as realizations of outcomes\n\n- columns of data can be thought as realizations of random variables\n\n| Finite Population         | Model-Based Approach                           |\n|-------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Finite population    | Data generated from a probability model         |\n| Outcomes are a subset of actual units         | Outcomes are generated from a distribution         |\n| Finite sample space         | Infinite or Finite sample space         |\n| Variability comes from the sampling | Variability comes from randomness in the model  |\n| Probability as frequencies | Model-based probability |\n\n## Discrete vs Continuous Random Variables\n\n- Random variables are classified based on the type of values they can take:\t\n\t- Discrete: values are countable (e.g., 0, 1, 2, ...)\n\t- Continuous: values fall in a range and can take infinitely many possibilities\n- Examples:\n\t- Discrete: number of heads in 10 coin tosses\n\t- Continuous: height of a randomly selected student\n\n\n## Discrete Random Variables\n<br>\n\nToday, we’ll look at three types of discrete random variables:\n\n- Bernoulli\n- Binomial\n- Poisson\n\n## Bernoulli\n\n- A Bernoulli random variable assigns a numeric value to the outcome of a single trial with two possible results:\n\n\t- The event of interest **occurs** → we call this a **success**\n\t- The event of interest **does not occur** → we call this a **failure**\n\n\n- Notation:\n$$X \\sim \\text{Bernoulli}(p)$$\n\nwhere $p$ is the probability of success fixed in advance (so $1 - p$ is failure).\n\n$$x = \\left\\{ \\begin{array}{ll}\n         1 & \\text{if oucome = success};\\\\\n         0 & \\text{if oucome = failure}\\end{array} \\right.$$\n         \n> for example: did a user click on an ad?
