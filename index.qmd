* Determine when data simulation is useful for analysis and plan appropriate simulations.

* Identify and manage outliers and anomalies, reflecting on their impact on conclusions.

* Address missing data, apply handling strategies, and assess their effect on conclusions.

* Perform exploratory data analysis with statistical and visualization methods to generate hypotheses.

* Evaluate the impact of measurement scales, units, and errors, and apply methods to minimize them.

* Assess data privacy needs, apply techniques where necessary, and reflect on their impact.

* Evaluate who owns the data in a given case.
