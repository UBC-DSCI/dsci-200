This is commonly known as a web address. \nThe base URL is the domain and part of the path that is included on all resources. It acts as the “root” for any particular resource.\n\nFor example, the GitHub API has a base URL of https://api.github.com/. \n\nAn endpoint specifies which resource on that domain you want to access.\n\nFor example, a specific user or organization on GitHub such as https://api.github.com/users/katieburak."

If you need to use an API key, you can create a separate script file in your repo (e.g., api-keys.R) which assigns the key to a variable. You can then include this script in a .gitignore file in your repo to prevent it from being shared with the world."

We will be using publicly available rubrics from the UBC MDS program, so for more details about each rubric type please visit https://github.com/UBC-MDS/public/tree/master/rubric.\n\n\nBefore diving into the case study, let’s make sure all the required packages are available. If any are missing, you can install them by uncommenting the relevant lines below (i.e., remove the # symbol before the install command).\n\n#install.packages('tidyverse')\n\nIn addition to tidyverse, this case study uses the hecedsm package. This package includes datasets used in the HEC Montréal course MATH 80667A: Experimental Design and Statistical Methods.You can read more about it here. To install it directly from GitHub:\n\n#devtools::install_github(\"lbelzile/hecedsm\")\n\nOnce all the necessary packages are installed, load them with:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(hecedsm)\n\n\n\n\nEach submission will be made on Gradescope (accessible via Canvas) and require the use of Jupyter to communicate the question asked, the analysis performed and the conclusions reached. Your submission must include:\n\nJupyter notebook (.ipynb file)\nRendered final document (.html or .pdf file)\n\n\n\n\nEach question will have a specific point value assigned to it. Points will be distributed across different components of the question depending on the question type.

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (60 points)\nWe will begin by applying some of the EDA concepts we learned in class in the upcoming tasks below.\n\nTask 1: Choose your favourite dataset (15 points)\nBefore moving forward, it is important to understand the context behind your data. In this task, you will start by choosing one of the studies listed above, then read the associated research paper and will load the dataset into R. This will give you a clearer picture of the study’s goals and how the data look like. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nChoose one of the studies of your choice from the options above. Download the paper from the provided link and load data in R. (Mechanics: 5 points)\nRead the paper and summarize goals of study. Write your summary in no more than 200 words and be sure to clearly explain: (Reasoning: 10 points)\n\n\nThe primary research questions or objectives the authors aimed to address\nThe importance or relevance of these goals in the context of the field\nAny specific hypotheses or outcomes the study sought to explore\n\n\n\nTask 2: Explore data (8 points)\nExploring data is a crucial step before producing any plots. This often helps us to detect any missing values and have a better understanding of the type of variables that we are working with. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nUse the glimpse() or head() function to examine your dataset. How many observations and variables are there in the dataset? (Writing: 1 point)\nWhat type of variables are in the dataset? (i.e numerical vs. categorical). Explain briefly. (Writing: 1 point)\nWould you need to convert any variable in the dataset before starting your analysis? Explain briefly why or why not. (Reasoning: 2 points)\nHow many missing values are there for each variable in the dataset? Are there any variables with a large proportion of missing data (e.g., more than 20%)? (Writing: 2 points)\nIs there evidence of class imbalance in any categorical variable in the dataset (e.g., one category makes up a large majority of the observations)? (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\n\n\nTask 3: Data visualization (15 points)\nAlright! Now we are ready to start making some plots to gain more insights into our dataset. While coding this in R please avoid using basic R functionality for plotting (functions such as plot, lines, ect) for this case study. You are welcome to use them later in your tasks, but we want you to learn using functions from ggplot and dplyr that we learned in class. For this task, answer three out of four questions of your choice.\n\nSelect two numerical variables from the dataset and name them here. What type of plot would be appropriate to explore the relationship between these two variables? Write the R code to produce this plot. Describe any pattern you observe. (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one numerical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? What is a typical observation from this distribution? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nPick one numerical and one categorical variable from your dataset. Using an appropriate plot, what insights can you draw about the relationship between these two variables? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one categorical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? Is there a “typical” value? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 4: Find summary statistics (10 points)\nIn this task, you will work with summary statistics. These numbers like means, medians, and standard deviations, can help us better understand patterns in the data, especially when used alongside plots. While we should not rely on summary statistics alone to draw conclusions, combining them with visualizations often gives a clearer picture. Choose and answer any two out of the three questions in this task.\n\nChoose one numerical variable from your dataset. Report an appropriate measure of central tendency and explain why this measure is appropriate for the variable you selected. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\nChoose one categorical variable from your dataset. Report a relevant summary statistic and explain why it is informative. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\nChoose two variables from your dataset and compute an appropriate measure of association to measure their relationship. Interpret the value in a simple language. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\n\n\n\nTask 5: Develop a question (12 points)\nBy now, you have spent some time exploring your dataset and have a better understanding of its structure and context. In addition to answering research questions, data scientists often play a key role in developing them. This task gives you a chance to practice that skill. Before attempting the questions, make sure to read the study’s paper carefully. Answer all of the questions in this task.\n\nThink of a research question you would like to explore using this dataset if you were the author of this paper. Write your question in one or two sentences in simple and plain language. (Reasoning: 4 points)\nBased on the question you wrote do you think you need to do the splitting of your data into train and test? Answer in two or three sentences. (Reasoning: 4 points)\nConsidering your dataset and research question, create a new feature derived from the existing variables in your dataset that could help you answer your question. Describe how you constructed this variable and explain why you think it will be useful. (Reasoning: 2 points + Coding: 2 points)"

Your goal is to recognize the sampling method that authors used in their study along with study design.\n\nTask 6: Describe design (15 points)\nUnderstanding the design of a study is important. You can often find some information about the design of a study in methodology section of a paper or its introduction part. Spend some time skimming through the text and answer all questions in this task.\n\nWhat type of data analysis questions are the authors of the paper hoping to answer? Recall the different types of data analysis questions you learned in DSCI 100 (e.g., descriptive, inferential, predictive, causal, exploratory). Which category or categories best describe the authors’ goals? (Reasoning: 5 points)\nDescribe the population and sample used in this study. Clearly define both the population of interest and the sample that was actually observed in the study. (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWas this an observational study or controlled experiment study? Explain your reasoning using relevant terminology. (Reasoning: 5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 7: Dive into the design! (10 points)\nAs we discussed in the lecture notes, it is important to think about the presence of confounding variable in a study design. Also there are sources of sampling bias that can occur due to the way we choose to sample from population. Answer two out of three questions in this task.\n\nDid researchers control for any confounding variable in this study? If yes explain how. If no, can you think of any potential confounding variable that you can adjust for? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWhat type of sampling method did the authors use? Cite the section of the paper where the sampling method is described or being inferred. Why do you think the authors chose this method over others? (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWere there any potential sources of sampling bias that may have affected the study’s conclusions? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 8: Now it is your turn! (10 points)\nHaving done the previous questions in different tasks, you now have a better understanding of the study that you chose. Take a moment to think about all you have explored here and use that to answer the following question:\n\nIf you were to design this study yourself, would you use a different sampling and design method? Why or why not? Reflect on what you might do differently and how your choice of sampling method might affect the results. Additionally, consider why the authors might have chosen not to use alternative sampling or design methods. What are the potential limitations or challenges of your proposed approach?

    "text": "What if I get sick during the semester?\nPlease follow the UBC CAMPUS RULES & GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.\nDO NOT COME TO CLASS.\nYou can complete all of your assignments electronically (and remotely).\nWe will drop the lowest worksheet grade from the semester.\n\n\nWhat if I get sick right before an exam?\nDO NOT COME TO THE EXAM. Your instructor will make alternate arrangements if you get sick right before/during a exam. Please contact your instructor as far in advance as possible, and fill out an academic concession form (available on the Canvas page).\n\n\nWhat is the structure of the class?\nEach week will have the following pattern:\nYour instructor will release pre-lecture reading material on Monday In class, your instructor will begin with a brief lecture to introduce a new concept. Then you’ll do a worksheet to practice the concept. In tutorial, the TAs will run a tutorial to reinforce the concept we learned in lecture. You’ll do another worksheet to practice the concept. The tutorial worksheets are generally harder than the lecture worksheets. There will be one midterm, one final exam, and one group project.\n\n\nHow do I submit a worksheet?\n\nWorksheets: You must complete all of your worksheets on our JupyterHub server. Once you are done working, go to File -&gt; Save and Checkpoint, and make sure the checkpoint is “a few seconds ago” at the top of your screen. We will show you how to do this in class. You don’t need to click “submit” anywhere – our server will automatically take a snapshot of your assignment at the due date. Make sure you do not move / rename your assignment from where it originally was on the server.\nCase studies / other assignments: You will submit these on Canvas.\n\n\n\nHow do I get my assignment regraded?\nPlease see the course syllabus.\n\n\nWhere do I find due dates?\nAll due dates are listed on Canvas.\n\n\nWhat if I registered late? When are things due?\n\nIf you registered after an assignment was due, then that assignment will be due exactly 1 week after your registration date & time.\nIf you registered before an assignment was due, the assignment from that class is due at the normal time.\n\n\n\nI’m going to be late / absent for a class! Who do I notify?\nYour instructor does not need to be informed when you’ll be absent from a regular class. We understand that, from time to time, you will not be able to attend the lecture sessions. However, since iClicker participation is a part of your grade, regular attendance is encouraged to ensure you can fully engage with the material and earn participation marks.\nIf you are going to be absent from an exam, you need to fill out a self-declared concession form in a timely manner prior to the exam. See the course policies on the syllabus for details.\n\n\nDo I satisfy the math requirement for this class?\nThe prerequisite for this course is DSCI 100.\n\n\nHow do I get help in the course?\n\nOffice Hours: The TAs and I will hold office hours at various times throughout the week via Zoom/in-person. See Canvas for times/locations. I encourage you to ask questions about the worksheets, case studies or any other questions about the course material.\nPiazza Discussion Board: You can post on the Piazza Discussion board to ask your questions about the course material. You can also help your classmates by answering their questions.\nEmail: For questions about the course material, please post your questions on Piazza. If you have personal questions that do not pertain to the course material itself you can email the course instructor (please see syllabus for emails). Please note: Most instructors only respond to emails Monday to Friday, and try their best to answer you as promptly as possible. However, given the large class size it may take a few days to respond.\n\n\n\nHow do I do well in this course?\nMost importantly: complete and understand the worksheets. These are intended to help you learn the concepts so you’ll do well on the case studies and exams. The worksheets tend to be a bit easier and provide more guidance.\nFor lecture worksheets, you can collaborate with your peers (this is encouraged!) as discussing the material while you work on it will help you learn. But you are not allowed to simply copy another student’s work. That is plagiarism, which is expressly forbidden in the course policy.\nTime management is very important in this course. There are regular assessments every week to keep you on track, but we move quickly and cover a lot of ground.\nTake an active role in the learning community that we will build together. Ask questions on Piazza when you have them, and try to answer each others’ questions when you can.\n\nAttribution: These FAQ have been adapted from DSCI 100’s FAQ."

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 1: Missing Values (40 points)\nReal datasets often contain missing values that can influence conclusions if handled poorly. In this case study, you will apply what we learned in class to identify missing data mechanisms, visualize patterns of missingness, and evaluate how different imputation strategies affect analysis results in simulated and real datasets.\n\nTask 1: Load and explore data (5 points)\nIn this milestone we will be working with the storms dataset from the dplyr package. The package contains information about tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic Ocean from 1975 onward. Each row represents a storm at a specific point in time, with variables such as storm name, year, month, day, time, latitude, longitude, wind speed, air pressure, and storm category.\nWrite your own code to load and examine the data and answer the following points.\n\nLoad this dataset into R. Copy the data into a new object called storms_dat. Set the seed at a value 123 before you start any analysis. (Mechanics: 1 point)\nHow many observations and variables are there in the dataset? (Writing: 1 point)\nUse the glimpse() or head() function to examine your dataset. What type of variables are in the dataset? (i.e numerical vs. categorical). Explain briefly. (Writing: 1 point)\nUse glimpse() or summary() for an initial scan of missing data. Which variables contain at least one missing value? (Writing: 1 point)\nGive one advantage and one limitation of using glimpse() or summary() to assess missing values in a dataset. (Reasoning: 1 point)\n\n\n\nTask 2: Summaries and Visualizations of Missing Values (15 points)\nWrite your own code to examine the data and answer the following points.\n\nThe naniar package provides several functions to summarize and explore missing values. Use one function in the package to investigate missingness in the dataset. Briefly describe what you learn about missingness in the dataset. (Writing: 2 points)\n\n\nNote: Recall that you may combine naniar functions with dplyr::group_by() if helpful.\n\n\nVisualizations allow us to see how missing values are distributed and to discover patterns that are difficult to detect from tables or summaries. Use the gg_miss_var() function from naniar to plot the number of missing values for each variable. Use the argument show_pct to display the percentage of missing values instead of counts. Does this visualization reveal any new insights about missingness? Briefly justify your answer. (Writing: 1 point)\nThe function gg_miss_fct() allows you to visualize missingness across the categories of another variable(s). Apply it to the dataset and briefly describe any patterns observed. (Writing: 1 point)\nAs you begin to better understand missingness in the dataset, you may be wondering whether missing values tend to occur in the same observations (storms) or independently across different ones. Use a naniar function to answer this question and produce a visualization. Briefly explain. (Writing: 2 points)\nUse ggplot to create a scatter plot to show the relationship between hurricane_force_diameter variable (which measures the diameter in nautical miles of the area experiencing strength winds of 64 knots or above) and tropicalstorm_force_diameter variable (which shows the diameter in nautical miles of the area experiencing tropical storm strength winds of 34 knots or above). What is the default behavior of ggplot2 for handling missing values? (Writing: 2 points)\nUse geom_miss_point() function in naniar package to add a new layer to your plot that displays missing values. Is the pattern of missingness consistent with what you observed earlier? Briefly justify. (Writing: 1 point)\nModify the plot by colouring points according to a variable you think may help explain the missingness pattern. If the colouring provides additional insight into the missingness pattern, briefly describe it; otherwise, explain what you tried. (Writing: 2 points)\nBased on your visualizations and exploration, what have you learned about the patterns of missingness in this dataset? Briefly describe how the missingness of different variables relates to other information provided in the dataset. (Reasoning: 4 points)\n\n\n\nTask 3: To impute or not to impute? That is one question! (20 points)\nAfter diagnosing and understanding the missingness in the dataset, the next step is to decide how to handle it. One common approach is imputation, but should we always impute? That is our first question.\nImputation is the process of replacing missing values with plausible estimates. The main challenge is often not how to impute, but whether imputation is appropriate and which method to use.\nIn this task, you will determine which variables are suitable for imputation, compare different imputation strategies, and decide how to handle variables with remaining missing observations.\nPre-processing data\nTo simplify the analysis and focus on a smaller set of observations, we restrict attention to storms observed from 2003 onward (inclusive). In addition, some imputation methods require the variable being imputed to be numeric.\nRemove # from code lines and run the cell below to prepare the dataset for the next questions, including additional information to track missingness.\n\n# storms_03plus &lt;- storms_dat |&gt;\n#     filter(year &gt; 2002) |&gt;\n#     mutate(tropicalstorm_force_diameter = as.numeric(tropicalstorm_force_diameter)) |&gt;\n#     nabular() |&gt;\n#     add_label_shadow()\n\n\nStructural missing values occur when a variable is not defined for certain observations (rather than simply unobserved). For example, tumor stage is not defined for individuals without cancer. These values should not be imputed.\n\nBased on your understanding of the dataset and previous exploration of missingness patterns, identify one variable whose missing values are structural (i.e., not applicable) and therefore should not be imputed. Briefly justify your answer. (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\nMICE uses all variables in the dataset and iteratively imputes all missing values, including those that are structural. To avoid imputing structural values, remove any variable identified in the previous question from storms_03plus before proceeding. Don’t change the name of the dataset. (Writing: 2 points)\n\n\nNote: Structural variables can also be retained by encoding the missing values as an explicit “not applicable” category. In this task, we exclude them for simplicity.\n\n\nBecause storm size and intensity are closely related physical characteristics, understanding the relationship between tropicalstorm_force_diameter and pressure is of substantive interest. Create a scatter plot of tropicalstorm_force_diameter (y-axis) versus pressure (x-axis) for storms in storms_03plus. Add a layer that clearly displays observations where these variables have missing values. Briefly describe the relationship and the missingness pattern. (Writing: 2 points)\n\n\nTip: Use faceting to explore if missingness has changed across years.\n\n\nMean imputation replaces missing values of a variable with the mean of the observed values of that variable.\n\nImpute the missing values of tropicalstorm_force_diameter using mean imputation and save the resulting dataset in an object called storms_mean. (Writing: 2 points)\n\nRegression imputation predicts missing values using a regression model based on other variables.\n\nImpute the missing values of tropicalstorm_force_diameter using linear regression with pressure as the predictor. Save the resulting dataset in an object called storms_lm_small. (Writing: 2 points)\n\nRegression imputation can incorporate multiple predictors to capture more structure in the data.\n\nImpute the missing values of tropicalstorm_force_diameter using linear regression with additional covariates. Use pressure + wind + lat + long + status as the the right-hand side of the impute_lm() to impute with a linear model estimated using all these predictors. Save the resulting dataset in an object called storms_lm_large. (Writing: 2 points)\n\nMultiple imputation iteratively imputes missing values using all variables in the dataset and generates multiple completed datasets to reflect imputation uncertainty.

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 2: Imputation Assessment by Simulation (30 points)\nIn the previous question, you compared different imputation methods and commented on potential limitations. However, such limitations are not always obvious when analyzing a single dataset. Simulation studies are a powerful tool for examining and comparing the performance of statistical methods under controlled conditions.\nIn this milestone, we use simulation to investigate how different imputation approaches perform in recovering the relationship between variables under missingness. Instead of simulating data from a theoretical distribution, as in the last worksheet, we generate random samples from the real dataset storms.\nTo create a baseline not affected by imputation, we first remove observations with missing values and treat the remaining complete cases as our reference population. Sampling from this dataset can be viewed as sampling from its empirical distribution. In other words, we assume that the complete observed data represent the underlying population.\n\nNote that this may not be a realistic assumption in practice, but we use it here only as a baseline to compare imputation methods under simulated missingness.\n\nLet’s first pre-process the data to create a simplified population dataset with more balanced groups.

Then remove # from code lines and run the cell. (Writing: 5 points)\n\n\nTip: Similar functions were used in the last worksheet.\n\nA key argument in many of the helper functions is the dataset (dat). Although some of the helper functions are written with a general data argument, they assume that the dataset passed to these functions contains the specific variables needed for the analysis (e.g., tropicalstorm_force_diameter).\n\n## Helper functions\n\n## Generate data\n# get_sample &lt;- function(dat, n_size){\n#   storms_sample &lt;- ... |&gt;\n#   slice_sample(n = ..., replace = FALSE)|&gt;\n#   ungroup()  \n# storms_sample \n#     }\n\n\n## Generate missingness MCAR\n# generate_mcar &lt;- function(dat, p) {\n#   missing_y &lt;- sample(1:nrow(...), size = round(p * nrow(dat)))\n#   dat$tropicalstorm_force_diameter[...] &lt;- NA\n#   dat\n# }\n\n## Linear regression estimation by least squares (LS)\n# fit_lm &lt;- function(dat) {\n#   lm(tropicalstorm_force_diameter~pressure + lat + type, data = dat) |&gt;\n#     tidy() |&gt;\n#     select(term, estimate, std.error)\n# }\n\n## Mean imputation, then LS estimation\n# est_mean_imp &lt;- function(dat) {\n#   dat |&gt;\n#     mutate(tropicalstorm_force_diameter = ...

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 3: Robust Methods in Motion Recognition (25 points)\nIn this milestone, we illustrate how robust statistical methods can improve movement recognition in video survillance tasks. We analyze a short video, filmed by a static camera, of a man walking a dog, available in the cellWise package.\nThe video consists of 54 frames. Each frame is a color image represented by three 144 \\(\\times\\) 180 grids of pixels corresponding to the Red, Green, and Blue (RGB) channels, respectively. A common way to analyze video data is to “flatten” each frame into a long vector containing all its pixel values. Thus, the data can be represented in a dataset with 54 rows (one per frame) and 77,760 columns (144 \\(\\times\\) 180 \\(\\times\\) 3) for each pixel value. In this activity we’ll flatten and reshape the data multiple times depending on the task using some helper functions.\nDimensionality reduction\nAlthough each frame has thousands of pixel values, the fixed camera results in most pixels belonging to a stable background that changes very little across frames. When rows in a dataset do not differ much, a useful technique to reduce the dimensionality is Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Intuitively, PCA captures the common background pattern shared across frames and expresses each frame as a slight variation of this baseline.\nTo do that, PCA creates new variables called principal components that summarize the main patterns of variation across observations in the data. The first component captures the dominant pattern. The second captures the next most important pattern in the remaining (residual) variation not explained by the first component, and so on. In many applications, only a few components are needed to represent most of the structure in high-dimensional data such as images.\nSince PCA may be new to many of you, we first illustrate this idea with a simple example using flower measurements in the iris data set, and then return to the video frames.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nPCA is not a learning objective in this course and we don’t expect you to know its details. However, it is a widely used technique in Data Science, which we use here to illustrate key concepts in robust statistics.\n\n\n\nTask 1: Classical PCA in R (5 points)\nIn this short activity, we use the iris dataset in R to build intuition for why highly similar rows can often be summarized by very few principal components. This dataset contains measurements for 150 flowers on four continuous variables describing the shape of the flower, as well as a categorical variable indicating species.\n\nDatasets: Let’s use iris to create four datasets, each with the same 4 numerical columns, but different “row similarity” structures.\n\n\nTrue: Use the original iris_numeric data, containing real variation across flowers, but keeping only the numerical variables.\nProportional: Keep the flower in the first row of iris_numeric as a “template” and create a dataset where every row is just a scaled version of that template (multiply all the row by different factors). This is an extreme case where all flowers share the same pattern and differ only in overall magnitude.\nSimilar: Start from the same template flower but this time create a dataset adding a very small amount of noise generated from a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 0.02. In this case, flowers are almost identical but vary slightly in multiple ways, not only in overall magnitude.\nDifferent: Create a synthetic dataset where the measurements vary more substantially across flowers with much less shared structure. Use a Normal distribution with mean 0 and standard deviation 1.\n\nComplete the code below to create these datasets, remove # from code lines and run the cell. (Writing: 2 points)\n\n# set.seed(1)\n# \n# # 1) iris dataset\n# iris_numeric &lt;- iris |&gt; \n#             ...(-Species)\n# \n# # 2) Proportional to first flower, different magnitude \n# base &lt;- as.numeric(iris_numeric[...,])\n# factors &lt;- seq(0.5, 2, length.out = 150) \n# iris_prop &lt;- ... %*% t(base) \n# \n# # 3) Similar flowers (`dir` keeps dependency among original variables)\n# dir  &lt;- c(1, 0.8, 1.2, 1.1)\n# z    &lt;- ...(150, sd = ...)\n# \n# iris_similar &lt;- ... + z %*% t(dir)\n# \n# # 4) Very different flowers (random, same dimensions)\n# iris_varied &lt;- matrix(...(150*4), ncol = ...)\n\n\nComputing PCA: You can now apply PCA to the four datasets using the function prcomp() from the stats package. We will use scale = TRUE, which standardizes each variable to have mean 0 and variance 1 before performing PCA. This ensures that all variables contribute equally to the analysis and that PCA focuses on patterns of variation rather than differences in measurement scale.\n\nPCA creates new variables called principal components (PCs). With four original variables, PCA produces four PCs, but they are ordered so that the first few typically capture most of the variation in the data. The principal component values (aka “scores”) are stored in the element $x of the PCA object (e.g., pca_iris$x).\nComplete the code below to create these datasets, remove # from code lines and run the cell. (Writing: 1 points)\n\n# # Compute PCA\n# \n# pca_prop  &lt;- ...(..., ...)\n# pca_similar &lt;- ...(..., ...)\n# pca_varied  &lt;- ...(..., ...)\n# pca_iris  &lt;- ...(..., ...)\n\n# head(pca_iris$x)\n\n\nVariation and PCs: The following code creates a dataframe summarizing the proportion of variation explained by each principal component (PC) for the four datasets. Remove # from code lines and run the cell.\n\nIn the Proportional rows dataset, PC1 explains almost all the variation. This occurs because the flowers differ only in overall magnitude: each flower is simply a scaled version of the same template, so all variation happens in one direction.\n\nIn which other dataset does PC1 explain a large proportion of the variation? Based on how the flowers differ in that dataset, explain why.\nWhich dataset needs multiple PCs to summarize the data? Why? (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\n\n# ve_df &lt;- data.frame(\n#   PC = rep(paste0(\"PC\", 1:4), times = 4),\n#   dataset = rep(\n#     c(\"Proportional rows\", \"Similar rows\", \"True data\", \"Varied rows\"),\n#     each = 4\n#   ),\n#   prop_var = c(\n#     (pca_prop$sdev^2)    / sum(pca_prop$sdev^2),\n#     (pca_similar$sdev^2) / sum(pca_similar$sdev^2),\n#     (pca_iris$sdev^2)    / sum(pca_iris$sdev^2),\n#     (pca_varied$sdev^2)  / sum(pca_varied$sdev^2)\n#   )\n# )\n\n# ggplot(ve_df, aes(x = PC, y = prop_var, fill = dataset)) +\n#   geom_col(position = position_dodge(width = 0.8), width = 0.7) +\n#   scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(accuracy = 1),\n#                      limits = c(0, 1)) +\n#   labs(\n#     x = NULL,\n#     y = \"Proportion of variance explained\",\n#     fill = NULL\n#   ) +\n#   theme_minimal(base_size = 12) +\n#   theme(\n#     legend.position = \"top\",\n#     panel.grid.minor = element_blank()\n#   )\n\n\n\nTask 2: Back to the video dataset! (10 points)\nIn the previous task, you saw that in same cases only a few principal components (PCs) can be sufficient to capture most of the important variation in a dataset. Let’s load and examine the video dataset.\n\nSome of the tools used in this analysis are beyond the scope of the course. Thus, we wrote some helper functions to implement those difficult steps: source(\"case-study-2-functions.R\")\n\nVideo data: Run the code below to load the data_dogWalker data from the cellWise package. Use the helper function called show_frame() to display a frame of this video. Remember that there are 54 frames so try passing different numbers to frame_number to “watch” the video in R!\n\nAs an example, we are showing the 10th frame\n\nRemove # from code lines and run the cell.\n\n# source(\"case-study-2-functions.R\")\n# data(data_dogWalker)\n# \n# # save data\n# dogWalker_dat &lt;- data_dogWalker\n# class(dogWalker_dat)\n# \n# show_frame(dogWalker_dat, frame_number = 10)\n\n\nReshape: Save the dimensions of the array in an object called dims. Use dims to reshape (flatten) the array into a dataframe with one row per frame and one column per pixel intensity (the product of the height, width, and RGB channels as previously explained).\n\nComplete the code below, remove # from code lines and run the cell. (Writing: 2 points)\n\n# dims &lt;- ...\n# dims\n\n## flatten into a dataframe\n#dim(dogWalker_dat) &lt;- c(dims[...], prod(dims[...:...]))\n\n\nDimensionality: The resulting dataset has too many variables. Can we use PCA to reduce the dimensionality without losing important information? Note that the background is largely stable since the camera is static, thus it does not vary in many independent ways across frames.\n\nBased on your previous examination of PCA, do you expect that much of the information in the frames can be represented using only a few PCs? Explain your response. (Reasoning: 2 points)\nThe man and the dog in the video move across the road and appear in different locations in each frame. Can you think of them as outliers? If so, what kind of outliers do you think they are and why? (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\nComputing classical PCA: The code below computes the first PC and its loadings. Each principal component is a weighted combination of the original variables (pixels). The loadings show how much each pixel contributes to the component. When displayed as an image, they reveal which regions PCA treats as background variation.\n\nLet’s look at the loadings of the first principal component. Is there any trace of moving man and dog? If so, it means some motion has leaked into the background estimate.\nRemove # from code lines, run the code below and briefly comment what you observe.\n\n# # Compute PCA\n\n# The following lines adds small variation where scale is zero to avoid division by 0\n\n# Xscales &lt;- colSds(dogWalker_dat)\n# fix &lt;- scale_filler_c(dogWalker_dat, Xscales, dims)\n# \n# # Start with fixed data\n# dogWalker_dat &lt;- fix[[1]]\n# \n# dogWalker_pca &lt;- prcomp(dogWalker_dat,  scale = FALSE)\n\n# # get the loadings and visualize those of PC1\n# cloadings &lt;- dogWalker_pca$rotation\n# cloadings_PC1 &lt;- cloadings[, 1]\n# \n## prepare loading for image \n# load1_img &lt;- prepLoading(loadings_PC1, dims[2:4])\n# \n# # visualization of the loadings of PC1\n# Pal &lt;- colorRampPalette(c(\"blue\", \"white\",\"red\"))(100)\n#\n# image(t(apply(load1_img$loading, 2, rev)),\n#       zlim = 2*load1_img$maxab * c(-1, 1),\n#       col = Pal)\n\nDoes the image of the loadings of classical PCA corroborate your previous hypothesis about reproducing the background without the man and the dog? Briefly justify your response. (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\nRobust PCA: PCA is based estimates of the mean and covariance matrix of the variables. Using classical sample estimates can make PCA extremely sensitive to outliers as well.\n\nIn the previous question you noticed that the pixels from the moving man and dog can “leak” into the PCA background estimate. Would this also happen if we use robust estimators?\nTo implement robust PCA, we start by using the function estLocScale() to obtain a robust location and scale estimates of the data. We then wrap the data and compute PCA.\n\nThis time we use the helper function scale_filler_r() to avoid scale estimates equal to 0.\n\nComplete the code below, remove # from code lines and run the cell. What differences you observed compared to the non-robust PCA analysis? Explain briefly. (Writing: 2 points)\n\nTip: follow the previous steps but now on wrapped data\n\n\n# locScaleX &lt;- ...(dogWalker_dat, precScale = 1e-12)\n# \n# # add minimum variation to the data if scale is close to 0 and re-estimate scale\n\n# fix &lt;- scale_filler_r(dogWalker_dat, locScaleX$scale, dims)\n# \n# data_filled &lt;- fix[[1]]\n# scale_fix &lt;- fix[[2]]\n# \n# # wrap `data_filled` using estimate of location and reviewed scale\n# Xw  &lt;- ...(data_filled, ...$loc, ...)$Xw\n# \n# # center wrapped data\n# XwC &lt;- sweep(..., 2, colMeans(Xw))\n# \n# # robust PCA: compute PCA on centered-wrapped data\n# dogWalker_rpca &lt;- ...(..., center = FALSE, scale. = FALSE)\n# \n# # get the loadings of the robust PC1 \n# rloadings &lt;- ...$rotation\n# rloadings_PC1 &lt;- ...\n# \n# # prepare loadings of PC1 for image \n# rload1_img &lt;- prepLoading(..., dims[2:4])\n# \n# # visualization of the loadings of robust PC1 \n# ...(t(apply(..., 2, rev)),\n#        zlim = 2*rload1_img$maxab * c(-1, 1),\n#        col = Pal)\n\n\n\nTask 3: Isolating moving objects (10 points)\nResiduals: If we think the moving objects as outliers, we should be able to identify them using the residuals, what is left over after the PCA reconstruction. Let’s take a look at each residual image. If a robust analysis is performed:\n\nLarge residuals indicate unusual or moving regions. In this case, the people walking in the video.\nBy standardizing and plotting these residuals, we can highlight outlier pixels that represent meaningful motion or anomalies.\n\n\nResiduals of classical PCA: Use the helper function compute_residuals() to compute the residuals of the classical PCA. Use show_frame_residuals() to visualize side-by-side an original frame, together with the residual image.\n\nRemove # from code lines and run the cell below.\n\n# # Compute the fitted frames and residuals:\n# aveX &lt;- colMeans(dogWalker_dat)\n# Xresidual &lt;- compute_residuals(dogWalker_dat, cloadings, aveX, k = 3)\n\n# # residuals as images\n#\n# locs &lt;- colMeans(Xresidual)\n# scales &lt;- colSds(Xresidual)\n# show_frame_residual(20, dogWalker_dat, Xresidual, locs, scales, 20)\n\nWhat do you observe? Was the classical PCA effective at isolating the moving objects from the background? Briefly explain your findings.

Students will broaden their applied statistical knowledge base and skillset required to dive into statistical and computational modelling in subsequent courses. Students will learn how to explore different layers of the data structure, consider the limitations introduced by the study design, acknowledge security and ownership features related to data, and address problems encountered in the data at hand. The course also aims to demonstrate how simulation studies can be carried out to examine properties of estimators and algorithms (i.e., beyond the data stage). The course reinforces and refines the computational skills (i.e., writing computer scripts), tools and resources learned in DSCI_V 100 to analyze data, as well as to draw and communicate appropriate conclusions."

You must attend the section you are registered in. It is your responsibility to make sure that the student ID and name associated with your iClicker account matches the Canvas gradebook. If you need help connecting to iClicker please see iClicker Cloud Student Guide.\nStudents who participate in at least 75% of iClicker assessments will receive full iClicker credit. Students who participate in at least 50% but less than 75% will receive half credit, and students who participate in under 50% will receive no credit. This participation-based grading scheme is designed to accommodate unforeseen absences or personal matters that may arise during the semester.\n\n\nCase studies\nThe case studies act as mini-projects and will provide additional practice with the data science skills we teach in the class. It is an extension to the worksheets by providing little to no prompts and scaffolding code. You will only be able to use the dataset(s) we have provided you to use. Further details regarding the case studies will be announced during the term."

    "section": "Policies",
    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 200 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate Registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate Assignments / Absences\nFor examinations, students must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, examination centre, etc) to take exams; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss an exam must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the exam (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the exam will result in a grade of zero.\nThere will be no extensions for the worksheets; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. Instead,the lowest worksheet grade from the semester will be dropped. This policy is meant to cover illness/unexpectancies. The worksheet that you were not able to complete before the deadline will be covered by this policy. However, if you have extenuating circumstances and require further accommodations for subsequent requests, please contact the course instructor with supporting documents, and we will deal with them case by case.\nStudents who miss a lecture for their registered section will receive an iClicker grade of 0 for that lecture. There will be no make ups for missing iClicker polls. Instead, we will drop the 2 lowest grades on iClicker lectures to accomodate late registration and/or unforseeable events.\nFor all other assignments including the case studies, a late submission will receive a 50% penalty.\n\n\nAutograder Policy\nMany of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes; any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.\nStudents are responsible for making sure their assignments are reproducible, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder. A common mistake is to manually download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of 0.\nIn short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.\n\n\nRe-grading\nStudents may review their midterm and final exams during the designated CBTF exam review windows. During this period, you may submit an issue if you believe a grading error occurred. All regrade requests should be reasonable and supported by clear justification.\nTo account for minor grading errors throughout the course, every student will get a bonus of one percentage point at the end of the semester. If you have a question about your score on a case study assignment or believe a grading error occurred, you may submit a regrade request through Gradescope. We only accept worksheet regrade requests for major errors in grading. If you think there is a grading error of more than 10% on a single worksheet, please submit a copy of your worksheet on Gradescope along with a regrade request. Regrade requests must be submitted within two weeks of the last scheduled class of the term.\n\n\nDevice/Browser\nStudents are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended.\n\n\nMissed Final Exam\nStudents who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic Concession Policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\nSee our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nUse of GenAI\nGenerative AI tools, such as large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, can be useful for exploring ideas, reviewing concepts, and troubleshooting problems. In this course, you may use these tools for those purposes, provided that any use of AI assistance in your coursework is properly cited. However, it is not permitted to complete assignments by copying and pasting AI-generated responses. All submitted work must reflect your own understanding and original effort.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code and/or text by automatic code-generation software or large language model\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during an exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related assignment.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.\n\n\nResources\nFor additional information, please check out these useful student resources, the survival tips from your TAs, and the Frequently Asked Questions. If you want to use any of this material elsewhere, please read the license.\n\n\nAttribution\nParts of this syllabus have been copied and derived from the DSCI 100 syllabus and the UBC MDS Policies."
