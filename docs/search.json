Students will broaden their applied statistical knowledge base and skillset required to dive into statistical and computational modelling in subsequent courses. Students will learn how to explore different layers of the data structure, consider the limitations introduced by the study design, acknowledge security and ownership features related to data, and address problems encountered in the data at hand. The course also aims to demonstrate how simulation studies can be carried out to examine properties of estimators and algorithms (i.e., beyond the data stage). The course reinforces and refines the computational skills (i.e., writing computer scripts), tools and resources learned in DSCI_V 100 to analyze data, as well as to draw and communicate appropriate conclusions."

    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 100 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate Registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate Assignments / Absences\nFor examinations, students must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, examination centre, etc) to take exams; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss an exam must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the exam (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the exam will result in a grade of zero.\nThere will be no extensions for the worksheets; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. Instead, we will drop the lowest worksheet grade from the semester. This policy is meant to cover illness/unexpectancies. The worksheet that you were not able to complete before the deadline will be covered by this policy. However, if you have extenuating circumstances and require further accommodations for subsequent requests, please contact the course instructor with supporting documents, and we will deal with them case by case.\nStudents who miss a lecture for their registered section will receive an iClicker grade of 0 for that lecture. There will be no make ups or accomodations for missing i-clickers. Instead, we will drop the 2 lowest grades on iClicker lectures to accomodate late registration and/or unforseeable events.\nFor all other assignments including the case studies, a late submission will receive a 50% penalty.\n\n\nAutograder Policy\nMany of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes; any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.\nStudents are responsible for making sure their assignments are reproducible, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder. A common mistake is to manually download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of 0.\nIn short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.\n\n\nRe-grading\nTo account for minor grading errors throughout the course, every student will get a bonus of one percentage point at the end of the semester.\n\n\nDevice/Browser\nStudents are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended.\n\n\nMissed Final Exam\nStudents who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic Concession Policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\nSee our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables) the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another the generation of code and/or text by automatic code-generation software or large language model An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during an exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related assignment.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.\n\n\nResources\nFor additional information, please check out these useful student resources, the survival tips from your TAs, and the Frequently Asked Questions. If you want to use any of this material elsewhere, please read the license.\n\n\nAttribution\nParts of this syllabus have been copied and derived from the DSCI 100 syllabus and the UBC MDS Policies."

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (60 points)\nWe will begin by applying some of the EDA concepts we learned in class in the upcoming tasks below.\n\nTask 1: Choose your favourite dataset (15 points)\nBefore moving forward, it is important to understand the context behind your data. In this task, you will start by choosing one of the studies listed above, then read the associated research paper and load the dataset into R. This will give you a clearer picture of the study’s goals and how the data look like. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nChoose one of the studies of your choice from the options above. Download the paper from the provided link and load data in R. (Mechanics: 5 points)\nRead the paper and summarize the main goals of study. Write your summary in no more than 200 words. (Writing: 4 points)\n\n\n\nTask 2: Explore data (10 points)\nExploring data is a crucial step before producing any plots. This often helps us to detect any missing values and have a better understanding of the type of variables that we are working with. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nUse the glimpse() or head() function to examine your dataset. How many observations and variables are there in the dataset? What types of variables are present (e.g., numeric, categorical)? (Reasoning: 1 point + Code Quality:1 point)\nWhat type of variables are in the dataset? (i.e Numerical vs Categorical). Explain briefly. (Reasoning: 1 point + Code Quality:1 point)\nWould you need to convert any variable in the dataset before starting your analysis? Explain briefly why or why not. (Reasoning: 1 point + Code Quality:1 point)\nHow many missing values are there for each variable in the dataset? Are there any variables with a large proportion of missing data (e.g., more than 20%)? (Reasoning: 1 point + Code Quality:1 point)\nIs there evidence of class imbalance in any categorical variable in the dataset (e.g., one category makes up a large majority of the observations)? (Reasoning: 1 point + Code Quality:1 point)\n\n\n\nTask 3: Data visualization (15 points)\nAlright! Now we are ready to start making some plots to gain more insights into our dataset. While coding this in R please avoid using basic R functionality for plotting (functions such as plot, lines, ect) for this case study. You are welcome to use them later in your tasks but we want you to learn using functions from ggplot and dplyr that we learnd in class. For this task answer three out of four questions of your choice.\n\nSelect two numerical variables from the dataset and name them here. What type of plot would be appropriate to explore the relationship between these two variables? Write the R code to produce this plot. Describe any pattern you observe. (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one numerical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? What is a typical observation from this distribution? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\nPick one numerical and one categorical variable from your dataset. Using an appropriate plot what insights can you draw about the relationship between these two variables? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one categorical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 4: Find summary statistics (10 points)\nIn this task, you will work with summary statistics. These numbers like means, medians, and standard deviations, can help us better understand patterns in the data, especially when used alongside plots. While we should not rely on summary statistics alone to draw conclusions, combining them with visualizations often gives a clearer picture. Choose and answer any two out of the three questions in this task.\n\nChoose one numerical variable from your dataset. Report an appropriate measure of central tendency and explain why this measure is appropriate for the variable you selected. (Reasoning: 3 points + Code Quality: 2 points)\nChoose one categorical variable from your dataset. Report a relevant summary statistic and explain why it is informative. (Reasoning: 3 points + Code Quality: 2 points)\nChoose two variables from your dataset and compute an appropriate correlation to measure their relationship. Interpret the value in a simple language. (Reasoning: 3 points + Code Quality: 2 points)\n\n\n\nTask 5: Develop a question (12 points)\nBy now, you have spent some time exploring your dataset and have a better understanding of its structure and context. In addition to answering research questions, data scientists often play a key role in developing them. This task gives you a chance to practice that skill. Before attempting the questions, make sure to read the study’s paper carefully. Then, choose two out of the three questions in this task to answer.\n\nThink of a research question you would like to explore using this dataset if you were the author of this paper. Write your question in one or two sentences in simple and plain language. (Writing: 6 points)\nBased on the question you wrote do you think you need to do the splitting of your data into train and test? Answer in two or three sentences. (Reasoning: 6 points)\nConsidering your dataset and research question, create a new feature derived from the existing variables in your dataset that could help you answer your question. Describe how you constructed this variable and explain why you think it will be useful. (Reasoning: 3 points + Code Quality: 3 points)"

Our goal is to recognize the sampling method that authors used in their study along with study design.\n\nTask 1: Describe design (15 points)\nUnderstanding the design of a study is important. You can often find some information about the design of a study in methodology section of a paper or its introduction part. Spend some time skimming through the text and answer all questions in this task.\n\nWhat type of data analysis questions are the authors of the paper hoping to answer? Recall the different types of data analysis questions you learned in DSCI 100 (e.g., descriptive, inferential, predictive, causal, exploratory). Which category or categories best describe the authors’ goals? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\nDescribe the population and sample used in this study. Clearly define both the population of interest and the sample that was actually observed in the study. (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\nWas this an observational study or controlled experiment study? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Code Quality: 2.5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 2: Dive into the design! (15 points)\nAs we discussed in the lecture notes, it is important to think about the presence of confounding variable in a study design. Also there are sources of sampling bias that can occur due to the way we choose to sample from population. Answer two out of three questions in this task.\n\nDid researchers control for any confounding variable in this study? If yes explain how. If no, can you think of any potential confounding variable that you can adjust for? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 4 points + Code Quality: 3.5 points)\nWhat type of sampling method did the authors use? Cite the section of the paper where the sampling method is described or being inferred. Why do you think the authors chose this method over others? (Reasoning: 4 points + Code Quality: 3.5 points)\nWere there any potential sources of sampling bias that may have affected the study’s conclusions? (Reasoning: 4 points + Code Quality: 3.5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 3: Now it is your turn! (10 points)\nHaving done the previous questions in different tasks, now you have a better understanding of the study that you chose. Take a moment to think about all you have explored here and use that to answer the following question:\n\nIf you were to design this study yourself, would you use a different sampling and design method? Why or why not? Reflect on what you might do differently and how your choice of sampling method might affect the results. (Reasoning: 5 points + Code Quality: 5 points)"

Using other languages is possible, but we have found that it often causes problems in the homework. We’ve done our best to fix them, but we may ask you to change it if you are having trouble.\nStudent user has full administrative access to the computer.\n\nAll other required software will be provided by the instructors. Students will learn to perform their analysis using the R programming language. Worksheets problem sets as well as the case study analysis, development and report will be done using Jupyter Notebooks accessed via Canvas.\n\nIf your computer does not meet the requirements please reach out to the teaching team and describe how it does not. We will work to accommodate you where we can."
