Students will broaden their applied statistical knowledge base and skillset required to dive into statistical and computational modelling in subsequent courses. Students will learn how to explore different layers of the data structure, consider the limitations introduced by the study design, acknowledge security and ownership features related to data, and address problems encountered in the data at hand. The course also aims to demonstrate how simulation studies can be carried out to examine properties of estimators and algorithms (i.e., beyond the data stage). The course reinforces and refines the computational skills (i.e., writing computer scripts), tools and resources learned in DSCI_V 100 to analyze data, as well as to draw and communicate appropriate conclusions."

    "text": "Git, Bash, and Windows Terminal\nAlthough these three are separate programs, we are including them in the same section here since they are packaged together in the same installer on Windows. Briefly, we will be using the Bash shell to interact with our computers via a command line interface, Git to keep a version history of our files and upload to/download from to GitHub, and Windows Terminal to run the both Bash and Git.\nGo to https://git-scm.com/download/win and download the windows version of git. After the download has finished, run the installer and accept the default configuration for all pages except for the following:\n\nOn the Select Components page, add a Git Bash profile to Windows Terminal.\n\n\nTo install windows terminal visit this link and click Get to open it in Windows Store. Inside the Store, click Get again and then click Install. After installation, click Launch to start Windows Terminal. In the top of the window, you will see the tab bar with one open tab, a plus sign, and a down arrow. Click the down arrow and select Settings (or type the shortcut Ctrl + ,). In the Startup section, click the dropdown menu under Default profile and select Git Bash.\n\nYou can now launch the Windows terminal from the start menu or pin it to the taskbar like any other program (you can read the rest of the article linked above for additional tips if you wish). To make sure everything worked, close down Windows Terminal, and open it again. Git Bash should open by default, the text should be green and purple, and the tab should read MINGW64:/c/Users/$USERNAME (you should also see /c/Users/$USERNAME if you type pwd into the terminal). This screenshot shows what it should look like:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nWhenever we refer to “the terminal” in these installation instructions, we want you to use the Windows Terminal that you just installed with the Git Bash profile. Do not use Windows PowerShell, CMD, or anything else unless explicitly instructed to do so.\n\n\nTo open a new tab you can click the plus sign or use Ctrl + Shift + t (you can close a tab with Ctrl + Shift + w). To copy text from the terminal, you can highlight it with the mouse and then click Ctrl + Shift + c. To paste text you use Ctrl + Shift + v, try it by pasting the following into the terminal to check which version of Bash you just installed:\nbash --version\nThe output should look similar to this:\nGNU bash, version 4.4.23(1)-release (x86_64-pc-sys)\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\nLicense GPLv3+: GNU GPL version 3 or later &lt;http://gnu.org/licenses/gpl.html&gt;\nThis is free software; you are free to change and redistribute it.\nThere is NO WARRANTY, to the extent permitted by law.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nIf there is a newline (the enter character) in the clipboard when you are pasting into the terminal, you will be asked if you are sure you want to paste since this newline will act as if you pressed enter and run the command. As a guideline you can press Paste anyway unless you are sure you don’t want this to happen.\n\n\nLet’s also check which version of git was installed:\ngit --version\ngit version 2.32.0.windows.2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nSome of the Git commands we will use are only available since Git 2.23, so make sure your if your Git is at least this version.\n\n\n\nConfiguring Git user info\nNext, we need to configure Git by telling it your name and email. To do this, type the following into the terminal (replacing Jane Doe and janedoe@example.com, with your name and email that you used to sign up for GitHub, respectively):\ngit config --global user.name \"Jane Doe\"\ngit config --global user.email janedoe@example.com\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nTo ensure that you haven’t made a typo in any of the above, you can view your global Git configurations by either opening the configuration file in a text editor (e.g. via the command nano ~/.gitconfig) or by typing git config --list --global).\n\n\nIf you have never used Git before, we recommend also setting the default editor:\ngit config --global core.editor nano\nIf you prefer VScode (and know how to set it up) or something else, feel free."

Github uses a Personal Access Token (PAT) for the Command Line Interface (CLI) and RStudio. This is different from the password you use to log in with a web browser. You will have to create one. There are some nice R functions that will help you along, and I find that easiest.\nComplete instructions are in Chapter 9 of Happy Git With R. Here’s the quick version (you need the usethis and gitcreds libraries, which you can install with install.packages(c(\"usethis\", \"gitcreds\"))):\n\nIn the RStudio Console, call usethis::create_github_token() This should open a webbrowser. In the Note field, write what you like, perhaps “DSCI 200 token”. Then update the Expiration to any date after December 15. (“No expiration” is fine, though not very secure). Make sure that everything in repo is checked. Leave all other checks as is. Scroll to the bottom and click the green “Generate Token” button.\nThis should now give you a long string to Copy. It often looks like ghp_0asfjhlasdfhlkasjdfhlksajdhf9234u. Copy that. (You would use this instead of the browser password in RStudio when it asks for a password).\nTo store the PAT permanently in R (so you’ll never have to do this again, hopefully) call gitcreds::gitcreds_set() and paste the thing you copied there."

    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 100 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate Registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate Assignments / Absences\nFor examinations, students must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, examination centre, etc) to take exams; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss an exam must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the exam (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the Instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the exam will result in a grade of zero.\nThere will be no extensions for the worksheets; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. Instead, we will drop the lowest worksheet grade from the semester. This policy is meant to cover illness/unexpectancies. The worksheet that you were not able to complete before the deadline will be covered by this policy. However, if you have extenuating circumstances and require further accommodations for subsequent requests, please contact the course instructor with supporting documents, and we will deal with them case by case.\nStudents who miss a lecture for their registered section will receive an iClicker grade of 0 for that lecture. There will be no make ups or accomodations for missing i-clickers. Instead, we will drop the 2 lowest grades on iClicker lectures to accomodate late registration and/or unforseeable events.\nFor all other assignments including the case studies, a late submission will receive a 50% penalty.\n\n\nAutograder Policy\nMany of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes; any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.\nStudents are responsible for making sure their assignments are reproducible, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder. A common mistake is to manually download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of 0.\nIn short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.\n\n\nRe-grading\nTo account for minor grading errors throughout the course, every student will get a bonus of one percentage point at the end of the semester.\n\n\nDevice/Browser\nStudents are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended.\n\n\nMissed Final Exam\nStudents who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic Concession Policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\nSee our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables) the translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another the generation of code and/or text by automatic code-generation software or large language model An “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during an exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related assignment.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.\n\n\nResources\nFor additional information, please check out these useful student resources, the survival tips from your TAs, and the Frequently Asked Questions. If you want to use any of this material elsewhere, please read the license.\n\n\nAttribution\nParts of this syllabus have been copied and derived from the DSCI 100 syllabus and the UBC MDS Policies."
