Students will broaden their applied statistical knowledge base and skillset required to dive into statistical and computational modelling in subsequent courses. Students will learn how to explore different layers of the data structure, consider the limitations introduced by the study design, acknowledge security and ownership features related to data, and address problems encountered in the data at hand. The course also aims to demonstrate how simulation studies can be carried out to examine properties of estimators and algorithms (i.e., beyond the data stage). The course reinforces and refines the computational skills (i.e., writing computer scripts), tools and resources learned in DSCI_V 100 to analyze data, as well as to draw and communicate appropriate conclusions."

    "text": "Policies\n\nCode of Conduct\nAll participants in our course and communications are expected to show respect and courtesy to others. To creating a friendly and respectful place for learning, teaching and contributing, you are expected to read and follow the DSCI 200 Code of Conduct.\n\n\nLate Registration\nStudents who register for the class late have 1 week from their registration date on Canvas to complete all prior assignments.\n\n\nLate Assignments / Absences\nFor examinations, students must be present at the invigilation venue (in class, examination centre, etc) to take exams; otherwise they will be considered to have missed the exam and will be assigned a grade of zero.\nStudents who will miss an exam must provide a self-declaration of academic concession prior to the exam (see Canvas homepage for the academic concession form) and make arrangements with the instructor. Failing to present a declaration within a reasonable timeframe before the exam will result in a grade of zero.\nThere will be no extensions for the worksheets; late assignments will receive a grade of zero. Instead,the lowest worksheet grade from the semester will be dropped. This policy is meant to cover illness/unexpectancies. The worksheet that you were not able to complete before the deadline will be covered by this policy. However, if you have extenuating circumstances and require further accommodations for subsequent requests, please contact the course instructor with supporting documents, and we will deal with them case by case.\nStudents who miss a lecture for their registered section will receive an iClicker grade of 0 for that lecture. There will be no make ups for missing iClicker polls. Instead, we will drop the 2 lowest grades on iClicker lectures to accomodate late registration and/or unforseeable events.\nFor all other assignments including the case studies, a late submission will receive a 50% penalty.\n\n\nAutograder Policy\nMany of the questions in assignments are graded automatically by software. The grading computer has exactly the same hardware setup as the server that students work on. No assignment, when completed, should take longer than 5 minutes to run on the server. The autograder will automatically stop (time out) for each student assignment after a maximum of 5 minutes; any ungraded questions at that point will receive a score of 0.\nStudents are responsible for making sure their assignments are reproducible, and run from beginning to end on the autograding computer. In particular, please ensure that any data that needs to be downloaded is done so by the assignment notebook with the correct filename to the correct folder. A common mistake is to manually download data when working on the assignment, making the autograder unable to find the data and often resulting in an assignment grade of 0.\nIn short: whatever grade the autograder returns after 5 minutes (assuming the teaching team did not make an error) is the grade that will be assigned.\n\n\nRe-grading\nStudents may review their midterm and final exams during the designated CBTF exam review windows. During this period, you may submit an issue if you believe a grading error occurred. All regrade requests should be reasonable and supported by clear justification.\nTo account for minor grading errors throughout the course, every student will get a bonus of one percentage point at the end of the semester. If you have a question about your score on a case study assignment or believe a grading error occurred, you may submit a regrade request through Gradescope. We only accept worksheet regrade requests for major errors in grading. If you think there is a grading error of more than 10% on a single worksheet, please submit a copy of your worksheet on Gradescope along with a regrade request. Regrade requests must be submitted within two weeks of the last scheduled class of the term.\n\n\nDevice/Browser\nStudents are responsible for using a device and browser compatible with all functionality of Canvas. Chrome or Firefox browsers are recommended.\n\n\nMissed Final Exam\nStudents who miss the final exam must report to their faculty advising office within 72 hours of the missed exam, and must supply supporting documentation. Only your faculty advising office can grant deferred standing in a course. You must also notify your instructor prior to (if possible) or immediately after the exam. Your instructor will let you know when you are expected to write your deferred exam. Deferred exams will ONLY be provided to students who have applied for and received deferred standing from their faculty.\n\n\nAcademic Concession Policy\nPlease see UBC’s concession policy for detailed information on dealing with missed coursework and exams under circumstances of an acute and unanticipated nature.\nSee our Canvas homepage for the academic concession form.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nThe academic enterprise is founded on honesty, civility, and integrity. As members of this enterprise, all students are expected to know, understand, and follow the codes of conduct regarding academic integrity. At the most basic level, this means submitting only original work done by you and acknowledging all sources of information or ideas and attributing them to others as required. This also means you should not cheat, copy, or mislead others about what is your work. Violations of academic integrity (i.e., misconduct) lead to the breakdown of the academic enterprise, and therefore serious consequences arise and harsh sanctions are imposed. For example, incidences of plagiarism or cheating may result in a mark of zero on the assignment or exam and more serious consequences may apply if the matter is referred to the President’s Advisory Committee on Student Discipline. Careful records are kept in order to monitor and prevent recurrences.\nA more detailed description of academic integrity, including the University’s policies and procedures, may be found in the Academic Calendar at http://calendar.ubc.ca/vancouver/index.cfm?tree=3,54,111,0.\n\n\nUse of GenAI\nGenerative AI tools, such as large language models like ChatGPT, Claude, or Gemini, can be useful for exploring ideas, reviewing concepts, and troubleshooting problems. In this course, you may use these tools for those purposes, provided that any use of AI assistance in your coursework is properly cited. However, it is not permitted to complete assignments by copying and pasting AI-generated responses. All submitted work must reflect your own understanding and original effort.\n\n\nPlagiarism\nStudents must correctly cite any code or text that has been authored by someone else or by the student themselves for other assignments. Cases of plagiarism may include, but are not limited to:\n\nthe reproduction (copying and pasting) of code or text with none or minimal reformatting (e.g., changing the name of the variables)\nthe translation of an algorithm or a script from a language to another\nthe generation of code and/or text by automatic code-generation software or large language model\n\nAn “adequate acknowledgement” requires a detailed identification of the (parts of the) code or text reused and a full citation of the original source code that has been reused.\nThe above attribution policy applies only to assignments. No code or text may be copied (with or without attribution) from any source during an exam. Answers must always be in your own words. At a minimum, copying will result in a grade of 0 for the related assignment.\nRepeated plagiarism of any form could result in larger penalties, including failure of the course.\n\n\nResources\nFor additional information, please check out these useful student resources, the survival tips from your TAs, and the Frequently Asked Questions. If you want to use any of this material elsewhere, please read the license.\n\n\nAttribution\nParts of this syllabus have been copied and derived from the DSCI 100 syllabus and the UBC MDS Policies."

    "text": "🏁 Milestone 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) (60 points)\nWe will begin by applying some of the EDA concepts we learned in class in the upcoming tasks below.\n\nTask 1: Choose your favourite dataset (15 points)\nBefore moving forward, it is important to understand the context behind your data. In this task, you will start by choosing one of the studies listed above, then read the associated research paper and will load the dataset into R. This will give you a clearer picture of the study’s goals and how the data look like. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nChoose one of the studies of your choice from the options above. Download the paper from the provided link and load data in R. (Mechanics: 5 points)\nRead the paper and summarize goals of study. Write your summary in no more than 200 words and be sure to clearly explain: (Reasoning: 10 points)\n\n\nThe primary research questions or objectives the authors aimed to address\nThe importance or relevance of these goals in the context of the field\nAny specific hypotheses or outcomes the study sought to explore\n\n\n\nTask 2: Explore data (8 points)\nExploring data is a crucial step before producing any plots. This often helps us to detect any missing values and have a better understanding of the type of variables that we are working with. Answer all questions in this task.\n\nUse the glimpse() or head() function to examine your dataset. How many observations and variables are there in the dataset? (Writing: 1 point)\nWhat type of variables are in the dataset? (i.e numerical vs. categorical). Explain briefly. (Writing: 1 point)\nWould you need to convert any variable in the dataset before starting your analysis? Explain briefly why or why not. (Reasoning: 2 points)\nHow many missing values are there for each variable in the dataset? Are there any variables with a large proportion of missing data (e.g., more than 20%)? (Writing: 2 points)\nIs there evidence of class imbalance in any categorical variable in the dataset (e.g., one category makes up a large majority of the observations)? (Reasoning: 2 points)\n\n\n\nTask 3: Data visualization (15 points)\nAlright! Now we are ready to start making some plots to gain more insights into our dataset. While coding this in R please avoid using basic R functionality for plotting (functions such as plot, lines, ect) for this case study. You are welcome to use them later in your tasks, but we want you to learn using functions from ggplot and dplyr that we learned in class. For this task, answer three out of four questions of your choice.\n\nSelect two numerical variables from the dataset and name them here. What type of plot would be appropriate to explore the relationship between these two variables? Write the R code to produce this plot. Describe any pattern you observe. (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one numerical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? What is a typical observation from this distribution? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nPick one numerical and one categorical variable from your dataset. Using an appropriate plot, what insights can you draw about the relationship between these two variables? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\nCreate an appropriate plot to show the distribution of one categorical variable in the dataset. What does the distribution tell you about the variable? Is there a “typical” value? (Reasoning: 2.5 points + Coding: 2.5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 4: Find summary statistics (10 points)\nIn this task, you will work with summary statistics. These numbers like means, medians, and standard deviations, can help us better understand patterns in the data, especially when used alongside plots. While we should not rely on summary statistics alone to draw conclusions, combining them with visualizations often gives a clearer picture. Choose and answer any two out of the three questions in this task.\n\nChoose one numerical variable from your dataset. Report an appropriate measure of central tendency and explain why this measure is appropriate for the variable you selected. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\nChoose one categorical variable from your dataset. Report a relevant summary statistic and explain why it is informative. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\nChoose two variables from your dataset and compute an appropriate measure of association to measure their relationship. Interpret the value in a simple language. (Reasoning: 3 points + Coding: 2 points)\n\n\n\nTask 5: Develop a question (12 points)\nBy now, you have spent some time exploring your dataset and have a better understanding of its structure and context. In addition to answering research questions, data scientists often play a key role in developing them. This task gives you a chance to practice that skill. Before attempting the questions, make sure to read the study’s paper carefully. Answer all of the questions in this task.\n\nThink of a research question you would like to explore using this dataset if you were the author of this paper. Write your question in one or two sentences in simple and plain language. (Reasoning: 4 points)\nBased on the question you wrote do you think you need to do the splitting of your data into train and test? Answer in two or three sentences. (Reasoning: 4 points)\nConsidering your dataset and research question, create a new feature derived from the existing variables in your dataset that could help you answer your question. Describe how you constructed this variable and explain why you think it will be useful. (Reasoning: 2 points + Coding: 2 points)"

Your goal is to recognize the sampling method that authors used in their study along with study design.\n\nTask 6: Describe design (15 points)\nUnderstanding the design of a study is important. You can often find some information about the design of a study in methodology section of a paper or its introduction part. Spend some time skimming through the text and answer all questions in this task.\n\nWhat type of data analysis questions are the authors of the paper hoping to answer? Recall the different types of data analysis questions you learned in DSCI 100 (e.g., descriptive, inferential, predictive, causal, exploratory). Which category or categories best describe the authors’ goals? (Reasoning: 5 points)\nDescribe the population and sample used in this study. Clearly define both the population of interest and the sample that was actually observed in the study. (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWas this an observational study or controlled experiment study? Explain your reasoning using relevant terminology. (Reasoning: 5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 7: Dive into the design! (10 points)\nAs we discussed in the lecture notes, it is important to think about the presence of confounding variable in a study design. Also there are sources of sampling bias that can occur due to the way we choose to sample from population. Answer two out of three questions in this task.\n\nDid researchers control for any confounding variable in this study? If yes explain how. If no, can you think of any potential confounding variable that you can adjust for? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWhat type of sampling method did the authors use? Cite the section of the paper where the sampling method is described or being inferred. Why do you think the authors chose this method over others? (Reasoning: 5 points)\nWere there any potential sources of sampling bias that may have affected the study’s conclusions? Explain your reasoning. (Reasoning: 5 points)\n\n\n\nTask 8: Now it is your turn! (10 points)\nHaving done the previous questions in different tasks, you now have a better understanding of the study that you chose. Take a moment to think about all you have explored here and use that to answer the following question:\n\nIf you were to design this study yourself, would you use a different sampling and design method? Why or why not? Reflect on what you might do differently and how your choice of sampling method might affect the results. Additionally, consider why the authors might have chosen not to use alternative sampling or design methods. What are the potential limitations or challenges of your proposed approach?

    "text": "What if I get sick during the semester?\nPlease follow the UBC CAMPUS RULES & GUIDANCE DOCUMENTS.\nDO NOT COME TO CLASS.\nYou can complete all of your assignments electronically (and remotely).\nWe will drop the lowest worksheet grade from the semester.\n\n\nWhat if I get sick right before an exam?\nDO NOT COME TO THE EXAM. Your instructor will make alternate arrangements if you get sick right before/during a exam. Please contact your instructor as far in advance as possible, and fill out an academic concession form (available on the Canvas page).\n\n\nWhat is the structure of the class?\nEach week will have the following pattern:\nYour instructor will release pre-lecture reading material on Monday In class, your instructor will begin with a brief lecture to introduce a new concept. Then you’ll do a worksheet to practice the concept. In tutorial, the TAs will run a tutorial to reinforce the concept we learned in lecture. You’ll do another worksheet to practice the concept. The tutorial worksheets are generally harder than the lecture worksheets. There will be one midterm, one final exam, and one group project.\n\n\nHow do I submit a worksheet?\n\nWorksheets: You must complete all of your worksheets on our JupyterHub server. Once you are done working, go to File -&gt; Save and Checkpoint, and make sure the checkpoint is “a few seconds ago” at the top of your screen. We will show you how to do this in class. You don’t need to click “submit” anywhere – our server will automatically take a snapshot of your assignment at the due date. Make sure you do not move / rename your assignment from where it originally was on the server.\nCase studies / other assignments: You will submit these on Canvas.\n\n\n\nHow do I get my assignment regraded?\nPlease see the course syllabus.\n\n\nWhere do I find due dates?\nAll due dates are listed on Canvas.\n\n\nWhat if I registered late? When are things due?\n\nIf you registered after an assignment was due, then that assignment will be due exactly 1 week after your registration date & time.\nIf you registered before an assignment was due, the assignment from that class is due at the normal time.\n\n\n\nI’m going to be late / absent for a class! Who do I notify?\nYour instructor does not need to be informed when you’ll be absent from a regular class. We understand that, from time to time, you will not be able to attend the lecture sessions. However, since iClicker participation is a part of your grade, regular attendance is encouraged to ensure you can fully engage with the material and earn participation marks.\nIf you are going to be absent from an exam, you need to fill out a self-declared concession form in a timely manner prior to the exam. See the course policies on the syllabus for details.\n\n\nDo I satisfy the math requirement for this class?\nThe prerequisite for this course is DSCI 100.\n\n\nHow do I get help in the course?\n\nOffice Hours: The TAs and I will hold office hours at various times throughout the week via Zoom/in-person. See Canvas for times/locations. I encourage you to ask questions about the worksheets, case studies or any other questions about the course material.\nPiazza Discussion Board: You can post on the Piazza Discussion board to ask your questions about the course material. You can also help your classmates by answering their questions.\nEmail: For questions about the course material, please post your questions on Piazza. If you have personal questions that do not pertain to the course material itself you can email the course instructor (please see syllabus for emails). Please note: Most instructors only respond to emails Monday to Friday, and try their best to answer you as promptly as possible. However, given the large class size it may take a few days to respond.\n\n\n\nHow do I do well in this course?\nMost importantly: complete and understand the worksheets. These are intended to help you learn the concepts so you’ll do well on the case studies and exams. The worksheets tend to be a bit easier and provide more guidance.\nFor lecture worksheets, you can collaborate with your peers (this is encouraged!) as discussing the material while you work on it will help you learn. But you are not allowed to simply copy another student’s work. That is plagiarism, which is expressly forbidden in the course policy.\nTime management is very important in this course. There are regular assessments every week to keep you on track, but we move quickly and cover a lot of ground.\nTake an active role in the learning community that we will build together. Ask questions on Piazza when you have them, and try to answer each others’ questions when you can.\n\nAttribution: These FAQ have been adapted from DSCI 100’s FAQ."
